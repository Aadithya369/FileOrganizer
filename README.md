A file organizer which takes the file based on its extension and puts them in a seperate directory if exists or just creates a new directory.
I will also be learning git and github while working on this repo so it dont mind the workflow and the structure of this repo.
I would love ur advice on how to structure the files and for any tips on the program as well.
This is just a personal project so this will be only be for *unix* like system "for now".
